# NATS Client Connection Management

This document explains the differences between the three primary functions used to manage connections to a NATS server: `nc.closed()`, `nc.close()`, and `nc.drain()`. Each serves a distinct purpose in handling the connection lifecycle.

## Functions Overview

### 1. `await nc.closed()`
**Purpose**: Returns a promise that resolves when the NATS client connection is closed.

**When to Use**:
- To wait for the client to finish closing and handle any errors that might have occurred during the disconnection process.
- Allows monitoring when the connection has terminated either manually (via `nc.close()` or `nc.drain()`) or due to external reasons like a server failure.

**Behavior**:
- If the connection closes cleanly, it resolves with `undefined`.
- If the connection closes due to an error, it resolves with the error.

```javascript
const done = nc.closed();
await nc.close(); // Trigger the close
const err = await done;
if (err) {
  console.log("Error occurred while closing:", err);
}
```

### 2. `await nc.close()`
**Purpose**: Closes the connection immediately.

**When to Use**:
- When you want to close the connection and don't need to wait for any pending messages to be sent or acknowledged.

**Behavior**:
- Closes the connection to the server immediately without any additional cleanup.
- Any unsent or unacknowledged messages might be lost.

```javascript
await nc.close(); // Shuts down the connection immediately.
```

### 3. `await nc.drain()`
**Purpose**: Gracefully closes the connection after ensuring all pending messages are sent and acknowledged.

**When to Use**:
- When you want to ensure all pending messages are delivered before closing the connection.
- Useful in production to prevent message loss.

**Behavior**:
- Waits for any in-flight messages (published or subscriptions) to be processed.
- After draining, the connection is automatically closed.

```javascript
await nc.drain(); // Ensures all messages are processed before closing.
```

## Key Differences

| **Method**       | **Description**                                                                 | **Message Handling**     | **Connection Behavior**                           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `nc.closed()`     | Waits for the connection to close (manual or due to error).                     | N/A                      | Resolves when the connection closes (cleanly or with errors). |
| `nc.close()`      | Immediately closes the connection.                                             | Pending messages lost.   | Abruptly closes the connection.                 |
| `nc.drain()`      | Gracefully closes after ensuring all pending messages are sent and acknowledged.| All messages processed.  | Gracefully closes the connection.               |

## Recommendations

- **Use `nc.drain()`** in production when you want to ensure all messages are delivered before closing.
- **Use `nc.close()`** for fast, immediate disconnection (e.g., during debugging or in non-critical use cases).
- **Use `nc.closed()`** to monitor and handle errors when the connection closes.
